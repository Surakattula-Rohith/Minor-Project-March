        <h2>About NASA</h2>
        <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is Americaâ€™s civil space program and the global leader in
            space exploration. The agency has a diverse workforce of just under 18,000 civil servants, and works with
            many more U.S. contractors, academia, and international and commercial partners to explore, discover, and
            expand knowledge for the benefit of humanity. With an annual budget of $23.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2021,
            which is less than 0.5% of the overall U.S. federal budget, NASA supports more than 312,000 jobs across the
            United States, generating more than $64.3 billion in total economic output (Fiscal Year 2019). </p>
        <br>

        <p>At its 20 centers and facilities across the country and the only National Laboratory in space NASA
            studies Earth, including its climate, our Sun, and our solar system and beyond. We conduct research,
            testing, and development to advance aeronautics, including electric propulsion and supersonic flight. We
            develop and fund space technologies that will enable future exploration and benefit life on Earth.</p>
        <br>
        <p>NASA also leads a Moon to Mars exploration approach, which includes working with U.S. industry, international
            partners, and academia to develop new technology, and send science research and soon humans to explore the
            Moon on Artemis missions that will help prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet. In addition to
            those major missions, the agency shares what it learns so that its information can make life better for
            people worldwide. For example, companies use NASA discoveries and technologies to create new products for
            the public. To ensure future success for the agency and the nation, NASA also supports education efforts in
            STEM with an emphasis on increasing diversity in our future workforce.</p>
        <br>

        <p>NASA is led by Administrator Bill Nelson, who became the agency's 14th administrator on May 3, 2021. Nelson
            served in the U.S. Senate for 18 years from Florida and as a payload specialist on space shuttle mission
            61-C in 1986.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The term "astronaut" derives from the Greek words meaning "space sailor," and refers to all who have been
            launched as crew members aboard NASA spacecraft bound for orbit and beyond. The term "astronaut" has been
            maintained as the title for those selected to join the NASA corps of astronauts who make "space sailing"
            their career profession.</p>
